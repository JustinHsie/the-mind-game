This is an original project idea (not from a tutorial or class) that makes an app adaptation of the card game 'The Mind'. Not affiliated with the official publishers in any way.

### Gameplay

In 'The Mind', all players are on the same team and dealt cards from a deck numbered 1-100. The goal is to place everyone's cards in the center pile in ascending order, one at a time. However, no communication is allowed - everyone must be synchronized and of one mind! If a card is played out of order, everyone loses; so look around at your teammates, gaze deep into their mind's eye, and place down your lowest card when you feel the time is right.
At Level 1 each player is dealt one card, then two cards for Level 2, and so on. See how many levels you can complete!
